Change upload filename to random characters / random numbers / date / other by yourself.

== Description ==

Sometimes we forgot change a available name for our file. So the plugin can help you auto change your upload file.
I will add a filetype option of setting in next version.
And a rename popup before the file upload if you change setting in future, default value is post_name.

There are many ways to install this plugin, e.g:

1. Upload compressed (zip) plugin using WordPress plugin uploader.
2. Directly install from WordPress.org directory
3. Upload manually uncompressed plugin file using FTP.
